## Note Taker

## Description
 
This is a repo to showcase a website that allows for note taking through a very easy using user interface as well as straight forward usage. The motivation of the creation of this was to allow for a place to write quick notes that will allow thoughts and tasks to be saved in a communal area for the user. The probelms this solves is that you're able to keep track of all things you've added or had in your mind and pushing them into a detailed and safe place to allow your thoughts to roam free and have more free space to think more rather than trying to keep remembering. I learnt how to use routes and how to add them into the JS to make a usable page and to allow for troubleshooting of code. 

## Installation

To use this you must just go to the deployed website as the npm I has already been run and you should have full acccess to everything on the front facing portal (webpage)
 
## Usage

 Go to webpage and write your deatiled note and have it stored for the next time you want to access the page.
